# Nexora Intro

Nexora is an innovative, modular DeFi yield protocol designed for simplicity and stability, leveraging cross-chain technology to seamlessly integrate with various DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains.

1. In the EVM ecosystem, Nexora supports deep integration with leading protocols such as Aave V3, Compound, Uniswap V3, Uniswap V2, Morpho, Gains, and Aerodrome.
2. On the Solana chain, it connects with top-tier protocols like Raydium, Jup, and Kamino
3. While on the Sui network, it is compatible with protocols such as Cetus and Navi.
4. We are also working on integrating with other chains like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche ...

What sets Nexora apart is its flexibility and creative potential. Users can design personalized investment strategies tailored to their needs or follow curated strategies created by experienced curators. Thanks to cross-chain technology, users can capture higher yields available on other chains without transferring their assets, significantly enhancing capital efficiency.

Moreover, Nexora's modular design empowers each curator to freely select their preferred protocol modules to craft strategies aligned with their specific goals. This flexibility not only caters to the diverse needs of users but also fosters limitless innovation among participants in the ecosystem.
