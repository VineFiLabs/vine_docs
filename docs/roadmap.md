# Roadmap

#### Alpha

Focus on Aave products to obtain the highest yields on stablecoins (USDC) across different networks of the Aave product.

#### V1

Integrate mainstream DeFi protocols in the EVM ecosystem to capture the highest yields across the entire EVM ecosystem.
Initiate incentive measures and open Share farming.

#### V2

Integrate mainstream DeFi protocols in Solana and Move ecosystems to capture the highest yields across all-chain DApps.
Continue incentive measures while Share farming rewards will be reduced.

#### V3

Introduce zk (zero-knowledge proofs) to achieve full decentralization.
Establish partnerships with multiple DeFi projects to expand community influence and incentivize curators to join.
End Share farming and transition to the final TGE (Token Generation Event).
