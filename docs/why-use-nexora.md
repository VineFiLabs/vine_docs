# Why Use Nexora?

1. With Nexora, users only need to select the tokens they want to invest in and click "deposit" to store them in Nexora. This allows users to effortlessly capture high yields from cross-chain DApp products without needing extensive knowledge of DeFi. Even beginners in Web3 financial management can use Nexora to simplify the steps of DeFi farming and quickly start earning efficiently.

2. Anyone can apply to become a strategy provider with Nexora, creating customized yield strategy modules and earning their own commissions in the process. This approach enriches Nexora's strategy library by offering diverse options, such as low-risk stablecoin investment strategies for conservative users and dual-token investment strategies for those willing to take on higher risks.

3. As a cross-chain protocol DApp, Nexora significantly accelerates asset liquidity across multiple chains, enabling seamless and efficient capital movement between blockchains. This contributes to the rapid development of the entire DeFi ecosystem.
