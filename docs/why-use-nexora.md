# Why Use Nexora?

### User-friendly and high-yield

With Nexora, the only thing that users need to do is select the tokens they want to invest in and store them in Nexora with a click. This allows users to capture high yields from cross-chain DApp products without having extensive knowledge of DeFi. Even beginners in Web3 financial management can start DeFi farming and earn profit efficiently with a few steps in Nexora.

### Modular strategies

Everyone can apply to be a curator with Nexora, creating customized yield strategy modules and earning their own commissions in the process. This approach enriches Nexora's strategy library by offering diverse options, such as low-risk stablecoin investment strategies for conservative users and dual-token investment strategies for those willing to take on higher risks.

### Cross-Chain Asset Liquidity Accelerator

As a cross-chain protocol DApp, Nexora significantly accelerates asset liquidity across multiple chains, enabling seamless and efficient capital movement between blockchains. This contributes to the rapid development of the entire DeFi ecosystem.

### Fair and transparent profit distribution mechanism

Nexora's fees are divided into protocol fees and curator commissions, both of which are calculated within the smart contract.
